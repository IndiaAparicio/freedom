# [Website](https://indiaaparicio.github.io/freedom/): Freedom

## This is a game about the interdependence between individual and collective freedom and how Corona measures affect these concepts.

**This repository serves as the hosting repository for the freedom-game. The game can be accessed - best with google chrome - at: https://indiaaparicio.github.io/freedom/**

You can find the documentation of the project [here](https://github.com/IndiaAparicio/freedomGam/documentations/documentation.md)

I have [another repository](https://github.com/IndiaAparicio/freedomGame) that serves as the documenting repository of the entire project. It contains all documentation, lists, texts, presentations, intermediate statuses and discarded files.
